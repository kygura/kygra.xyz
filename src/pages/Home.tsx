        There's a kind of person who comes to understand... that the game being played on the surface is not the actual game. That life as it is currently being presented is not an active state of living, but a slow erasure and annihilation of the humane; as it is replaced by the machine-like.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we inherited was its husk. The form without the substance. Democracy as a marketing term. Freedom as the freedom to choose the size of your cage. Meaning as something you're supposed to find on your own time, after your shift.
      </p>
    </>,
    <>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Meaning used to be an experience and state of being inherit in a simpler lifestyle guided by the need for survival. Now it is surrogated as an external and commodified into a product one must buy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The promise is: You'll find your meaning on a subscription plan... a new job... a new relationship... Meaning is understood as this external source of fulfillment, something that you can't create for yourself, but must seek out.

        You cannot vote your way out of this. You cannot hustle your way out of it either — the hustle is part of the same machine, repackaged as resistance. Three side incomes and a growth mindset is not emancipation. It is participation with extra steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Posed differently: <em>how do I live?</em> Not "how do I succeed" — success does not mean much if you remain confined and captive in the system.

        Treat life as a game you didn't design but have to play. Not with cynicism, but positive indifference. With clarity. The rules are visible if you stop pretending they're natural.

        You learn to read the structure of what surrounds you — the market, the institution, the social system — and you find the degrees of freedom that the structure inadvertently permits.
